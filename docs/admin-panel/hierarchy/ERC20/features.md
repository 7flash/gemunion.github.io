# Features

### SIMPLE

The SIMPLE contract is a foundational component of all features offered by our platform. It includes all the basic functions such as **mint**, **burn**, and **transfer**.

#### Consist of several contracts:
- **Access Control** - Provides the ability to restrict or grant permission for specific addresses to interact with the smart contract. _(see [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control))_
- **Burnable** -  Allows for a token to be destroyed, reducing the overall supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. (see [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Burnable))
- **Capped** - Limits the total supply of tokens that can be minted, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens. _(see [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Capped))_
- **Snapshot** - Provides the ability to take a snapshot of token balances for later reference or use. (see [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Snapshot))
