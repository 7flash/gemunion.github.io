# Composable ERC998 Tokens

The **ERC998** token is a valuable addition to the existing standards, and it enables a whole new range of use cases.
Main feature of **ERC998** is an ability to be composed. It means that each **ERC998** token can own another tokens (
ERC20, ERC721, ERC998 or ERC1155) as a child and traded using a single transfer of ownership.

# Notes

While it looks like a good idea to add each and every token as a potential child, in real life application its most
likely impossible to wear CryptoKitty as a helmet of your character, because there is no such texture in the game.
Another thing is about amount of children of the same type, i.e. wear 10 helmets at a time does not seem reasonable.

We offer a filter to apply custom rules to restrict children.
