# Features


### PAUSABLE

The Pausable feature in smart contracts allows the contract owner or authorized parties to temporarily pause the execution of the contract, which can be useful for addressing unexpected bugs or errors or for making updates. This added layer of security and control is particularly useful in the sale of mystery boxes, where the contract can be paused until the NFTs are ready. The Pausable feature in ERC721 contracts offers greater flexibility and control, making it an important feature for any NFT-based project.


### UPGRADEABLE

The Upgradeable feature allows NFT owners to enhance their assets with attributes like level, power, and stamina, increasing the value and desirability of the NFTs. This is especially valuable in gaming platforms, where players can upgrade their NFTs to improve in-game abilities or earn more in-game currency. The Upgradeable feature positively impacts the NFT economy by increasing the value of upgraded tokens and leading to more transactions and potential token burn.


### GENES

The Genes feature allows for the creation and management of inheritable traits within NFTs, adding a new level of complexity and depth to the NFT ecosystem. This has been utilized in popular NFT projects like Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties for breeding and trading creatures with unique traits, as well as in projects for creating rare and valuable plant NFTs. The Genes feature opens up new opportunities for NFT creators, collectors, and gamers alike.


### RANDOM

The RANDOM feature allows for random events to be generated within a blockchain application using the decentralized oracle service, ChainLink, to ensure fairness and transparency. When combined with the Upgradeable feature, the RANDOM feature creates a unique and dynamic NFT economy where NFT value is determined by player effort and luck. The RANDOM feature also enhances the overall user experience when combined with other features such as GENES and MYSTERY BOX.


### SOULBOUND

The SOULBOUND feature ties ownership of an NFT to a specific individual, providing a secure way to manage important and high-value NFTs. This is particularly useful for Governance tokens, where SOULBOUND can be used as a voting pass to prevent fraudulent or duplicated voting. The SOULBOUND feature provides a way to effectively manage the distribution and ownership of NFTs.


### MYSTERY BOX

The MYSTERY BOX feature adds an element of excitement and unpredictability to NFT-based games. Users can purchase a MYSTERY BOX and receive a surprise reward, creating a sense of excitement and unpredictability for players. This feature is particularly useful in the gaming industry, where it adds an extra layer of excitement to the user experience.
