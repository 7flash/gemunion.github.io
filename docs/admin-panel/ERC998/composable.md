# Composable

Main feature of ERC998 is an ability to be composed. It means that ERC998 token can have another token (ERC20, ERC721,
ERC998 and ERC1155) as a child.

While it looks like a good idea to add each and every token as a potential child in real life application its most
likely impossible to wear CryptoKitty as a helmet of your character because there is no such texture in the game.
Another thing is and amount of children of the same type, wear 10 helmets at a time does not seem reasonable too. So we
offer a filter to apply custom rules to restrict children.
