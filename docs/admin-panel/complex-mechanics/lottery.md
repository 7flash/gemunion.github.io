# Lottery

Lottery is a gambling mechanic based on guessing numbers. Users are offered to guess 6 out of 36 for 70% of tokens spent
on tickets. The rest 30% is taken as a fee by system. System starts new round automatically every day at desired time,
and ends round next day at the same time. Random numbers are calculated based on randomness obtained
from [ChainLink](/docs/integrations/chain-link/) service

## Deployment

Staking contract is deployed as system contract by initial setup script.

### Configuration options

Lottery comes with no configuration, all adjustments are made by us in contract's code.
