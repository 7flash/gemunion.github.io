# Claim

Claim is the simplest and thus first available mechanic for NFTs. Claim meant to be a reward for some sort of marketing
campaign and is given for free (for the cost of transaction), while other mechanics are in development.

Basically claim is a pre-signed transaction that user can execute to receive a reward. One claim can contain multiple
items of different types including [mystery box](/docs/admin-panel/mechanics/mysterybox/)

## Configuration

To start giving away items you have to create [templates](/docs/admin-panel/hierarchy/ERC721/template/) first.

### Configuration options

- **account** - The address of beneficiary
- **item** - The item (or items) to be claimed (see [asset](/docs/admin-panel/miscellaneous/asset/))
- **end date** - The expiration date of the transaction
