# Craft

Craft allows to user to exchange tokens with a given proportion from in-game store.

Here are some common scenarios for crafting:

1. Craft resources of the higher grade. User can craft ERC1155 token from several others ERC1155 tokens. This way iron
   ore can be refined to iron ingots.
2. Craft items from resources. User can craft ERC721 token from several others ERC1155 tokens. This way iron ingot
   becomes a sword

## Configuration

To start crafting items you have to create these items first, [see](/docs/admin-panel/ERC1155/template/)

### Configuration options

- **item** - an item to be crafted
- **ingredients** - a list of tokens that are required to craft the item, while you can add ETH and ERC20 to the mix,
  this mechanic is not meant for direct purchase
