# Dropbox

DropBox, MisteryBox, LootBox, GachaBox are the different names for the item with random content. While template of the
content is known, its rarity attribute is not. This way user can gamble in two ways: open the box and get random result,
or sell the box and get more money

## Configuration

To start using dropboxes you have to create template first, [see](/docs/admin-panel/ERC721/template/)

You also have to fund a contract with [LINK](/docs/integrations/ChainLink/) token.

### Configuration options

- **title** - This is how template is displayed on site, especially on marketplace
- **description** - General description in markdown format.
- **item** - the item to be hidden inside the box
- **price** - a price on marketplace
- **status** - defines whether item is sellable on marketplace
- **image** - image to be shown on internal and external marketplaces
