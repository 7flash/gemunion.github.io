# Airdrop

Airdrop is the simplest and thus first available mechanic for NFT, it meant to be a reward for some sort of competition.

Basically it is a wrapper NFT which acts like a factory and can produce another NFT while being opened. Opening of
airdropped NFT causes the original NFT to be burned while user receives a wrapped NFT from desired collection. This
mechanic could be combined with getting [on-chain randomness](/docs/integrations/ChainLink/)
