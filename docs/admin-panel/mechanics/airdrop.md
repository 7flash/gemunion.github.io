# Airdrop

Airdrop is the simplest and thus first available mechanic for NFTs, it meant to be a reward for some sort of competition.
Airdropped tokens are given as a reward and usually free.

Basically it is a wrapper NFT which acts like a factory and can produce another NFT while being opened. Opening of
airdropped NFT causes the original NFT to be burned while user receives a wrapped NFT from desired collection. This
mechanic could be combined with getting [on-chain randomness](/docs/integrations/ChainLink/)

## Configuration

To start air-dropping items you have to create these items first, [see](/docs/admin-panel/ERC721/template/)

### Configuration options

- **account** - account that can claim an item
- **item** - the item to be claimed, could contain any NFT
