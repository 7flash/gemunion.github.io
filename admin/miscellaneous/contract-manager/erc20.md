# ERC20

ERC20ContractManager is a contract that facilitates the deployment and management of ERC20 tokens on the blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and deploying new tokens, as well as managing existing ones. 

### Deployment options:

- **name** - Name of the ERC20 token.
- **symbol** - Symbols that would be shown on different Exchanges.
- **cap** - Maximum token supply.
- **contractTemplate** - Smart contract template with its unique functions. (See available features [here](/admin/hierarchy/ERC20/features))

The contract validates the input and creates a new ERC20 token contract on the blockchain.
