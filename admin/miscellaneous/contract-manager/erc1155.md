# ERC1155

ERC1155ContractManager is a contract that facilitates the deployment and management of ERC1155 tokens on the blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and deploying new tokens, as well as managing existing ones.

### Deployment options:

- **contractTemplate** - Smart contract template with its unique functions. (See available features [here](/admin/hierarchy/ERC1155/features))
- **baseTokenURI** - The base URI of the token metadata. (usually a stand-alone [JSON microservice](/api/category/json-microservice/) server or IPFS).
- **royalty** - Royalty fee to be paid to the original creator of the token. ([EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981))

The contract validates the input and creates a new ERC1155 token contract on the blockchain.
