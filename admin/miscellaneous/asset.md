# Asset

**Asset** is one of the pillars of our architecture that is used to **represent digital items on the blockchain**.
It is the basic unit of data transmission for transactions involving tokens, allowing for accurate definition of the
interaction with the token on the blockchain. Assets can represent fungible and non-fungible tokens, and are crucial for
transferring tokens between addresses within our ecosystem.
