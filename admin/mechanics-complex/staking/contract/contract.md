# Contract

Staking is a mechanic which allows user to deposit one kind of token and gain an interest over time in some other token. This could be compared with a bank deposit. 

On early stages of the project, when [ERC20](/admin/category/erc20/) token is just emitted it could be used to retain liquidity of this coin.
On middle and late stages it could be used for passive income

## Use case examples

1. The project could configure Staking contract to accept [ERC20](/admin/category/erc20/) and give unique [token in the box](/admin/mechanics-simple/mystery/box) as an interest.

2. Imagine user got 10 [Heroes](/admin/category/erc998/), but he can use only 5 in his squad. What can he do with the rest? 
Of course, he can sell redundant NFTs, but he also can make them work in a mine to gain passive income. 
Let's say project has configured mine to accept [Hero](/admin/category/erc998/) and give [metal ore](/admin/category/erc1155/) as an interest.
5 metal ore per day per character, maximum 5 character per mine. 
This will make user to want to have 10 Heroes instead of 5.

3. Staking can also be used to offer users off-chain benefits in addition to on-chain rewards. For example, a user could deposit game tokens into a Staking contract and receive a bonus off-chain, such as a higher drop of in-game resources. The Staking contract would only modify on-chain data to record the deposit and emit an event, while the off-chain benefits would be handled by the game server. This allows for more flexible rewards and a better user experience.
