# Chain Link

[Chain Link](https://chain.link/) is a huge ecosystem that acts as an Oracle for blockchain.

Smart contract can't get any information from off-chain by itself thus required information must be passed to it from
off-chain by executing transaction. This is what ChainLink does. One of the data type which they can pass to blockchain
is randomness. We use it to generate rarity parameter at token mint time.

More information about how it works can be found [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/)
