# Contract

An ERC20 token represents a currency or utility token and is widely used in DeFi (decentralized finance) applications
for purposes such as trading, lending, and borrowing. ERC20 tokens provide a standard set of rules for creating and
managing tokens, making it easier for managers to create new tokens that are compatible with existing wallets and
exchanges. They are also the most commonly used type of token in ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and other token sales.

## Contract actions
