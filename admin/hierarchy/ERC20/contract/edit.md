# Configuration

After the contract is deployed it has to be manually edited before becoming visible on the market

## Configuration options

While deployment options are used as default values, there are still things to configure

- **title** - This is how token is displayed on site, mostly in autocomplete fields for other actions
- **description** - General description. Supports Markdown format. Optional and present mostly for compatibility with other tokens
- **token status**
    - **NEW** - Default status after contract deployment, should be manually changed to **ACTIVE**
    - **ACTIVE** - Active tokens are displayed on site and available for selection for other actions
    - **INACTIVE** - Inactive tokens are not available for selection
