# Contract

ERC721 contract is used for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent unique items such as simple images, in-game items, characters, and more. These tokens are unique and cannot be interchanged, making them ideal for representing one-of-a-kind digital assets. NFTs have become increasingly popular in the art world and in DeFi as a way to represent ownership and value of unique digital assets.
