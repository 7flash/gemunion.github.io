# Contract

The **ERC998** contract is an extension of the **ERC721** contract, as it represents non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and can
be used to create unique items such as images, in-game items, characters, and more. However, ERC998 also includes
additional features such as [composition](/admin/hierarchy/ERC998/composition), which allows multiple tokens to be
combined into a single token. This is useful for creating more complex NFTs or for representing ownership of
multiple [assets](/admin/miscellaneous/asset) in a single token.

To understand the basic behavior of the **ERC998 contract**, you can refer to
the [ERC721 contract](/admin/hierarchy/ERC721/contract).
