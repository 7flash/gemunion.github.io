# Contract

The **ERC998** contract is similar to the **ERC721** contract, as it represents non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and can be used to create unique items such as images, in-game items, characters, and more. However, ERC998 also includes additional features such as [composition](/admin/hierarchy/ERC998/composition), which allows multiple tokens to be combined into a single token. This is useful for creating more complex NFTs or for representing ownership of multiple [assets](/admin/miscellaneous/asset) in a single token.

<!-- **ERC998** contract is an extension of the **ERC721** standard that enables non-fungible tokens to own other non-fungible tokens, creating a tree-like structure. This allows for more complex ownership and [composition](/admin/hierarchy/ERC998/composition) of assets, such as a game character owning a sword and a shield. -->

To understand the basic behavior of the **ERC998 contract**, you can refer to the [ERC721 contract](/admin/hierarchy/ERC721/contract).
<!-- ERC998 contract behave exactly like [ERC721](/admin/hierarchy/ERC721/contract/), so yoy can find all necessary information on ERC721 contract. -->
