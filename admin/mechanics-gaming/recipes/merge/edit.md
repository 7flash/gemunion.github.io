# Configuration

We discourage merchants to completely rewrite recipes because there would be mess in Event History table showing both
new and old items crafted from the same recipe.

## Configuration options

- **item** - An [item](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) to be created
- **price** - A list of [item(s)](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) that are being merged
