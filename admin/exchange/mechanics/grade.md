# Grade
Grade is an exchange mechanism for upgrading the metadata of an existing asset. Users can upgrade their assets by paying with the specified assets required by the asset's template. Only one asset can be upgraded per transaction, and at least one asset must be transferred for payment. While it's possible to use multiple assets for payment, but it's important to be cautious since using too many payment assets can significantly increase the gas cost of the transaction.

You can find more details how to configure Grade mechanic [here](/admindialog.pnggrade).
