# Grade

Grade is a mechanism that allows management of the token's properties. In GameFi projects, the grade mechanic is
particularly useful as it provides a way to track the progress and value of an NFT over time.

The grade level of an NFT is displayed on [marketplaces](/api/json/marketplaces/) and serves as an indicator of the
token's quality and value. The higher the grade level, the more valuable and desirable the NFT is likely to be.

Attribute value starts from 0, that means attribute does not exist. Only existing attributes are reflected in metadata
and displayed on market.
