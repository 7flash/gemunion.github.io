# Claim

Claim is a basic mechanic in the world of blockchain to give away an [asset](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/)
for the cost of transaction.

Claims are a great way to reward users for their participation in various activities. For example:
- For participation in marketing campaigns
- For killing minions and other in-game actions
- Can be used to redeem off-chain balance on-chain

Claim can be combined with [vesting](/admindialog.pngvesting), [mystery boxes](/admindialog.pngmystery/box) and achievements

> **NOTE!** When the user receives a **ERC721**, **ERC998**, or **ERC1155** token, it will be
> **minted**, while **NATIVE** or **ERC20** tokens will be **spent** from the merchants balance.
