# Merge

Merge is a mechanic used to produce new tokens by combining existing tokens into new one in proportions.

Here are some common scenarios for merging:

1. Merge items of the higher grade. User can merge several ERC721 tokens into another ERC721. 
   This way X swords can be merged to 1 mace.

To start merging items you have to create at least two [items](/admin/hierarchy/ERC721/template/) first
