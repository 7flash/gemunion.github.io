# Configuration

We discourage merchants to completely rewrite recipes because there would be mess in Event History table showing both
new and old items dismantled from the same recipe.

## Configuration options

- **item** - An [item](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) being dismantled
- **price** - A list of [items](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) produced as the result of the dismantle operation
