# Creation

This mechanic can be configured in any way you like, for example:

- ERC721 -> ERC1155
- ERC998 -> ERC1155
- ERC721 -> ERC1155 + NATIVE
- ERC721 -> ERC1155 + ERC20
- ERC721 -> ERC1155 + ERC1155

> **NOTE!** <br/>
> While it's possible to use multiple assets for payment, it's important
to note that using too many payment assets can significantly increase the gas cost of the transaction and may even reach
the network limit.

## Creation options

- **item** - A list of [items](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) being created
- **price** - An [item](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) being dismantled
