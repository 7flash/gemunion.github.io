# Creation

While this mechanic can be configured in any way you like, for example ERC1155 -> ERC1155 or ERC1155 -> ERC721, we
discourage to configure it as pure purchase mechanic (ERC20 -> ERC721)

It is possible to create more than one recipe to craft the same item.

## Creation options (craft)

- **item** - An [item(s)](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) to be crafted
- **price** - A list of [item(s)](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) that are required to craft (item being dismantled)

## Creation options (dismantle)

- **item** - A list of [items](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) produced as the result of the dismantle operation
- **price** - An [item](/admin/miscellaneous/asset/) being dismantled
