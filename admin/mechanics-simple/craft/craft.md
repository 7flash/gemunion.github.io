# Craft

Craft is a mechanic used to produce new tokens by exchanging existing tokens for new ones in proportions.

Here are some common scenarios for crafting:

1. Craft resources of the higher grade. User can craft ERC1155 token from several others ERC1155 tokens. 
   This way X iron ore can be refined to Y iron ingots.
2. Craft items from resources. User can craft ERC721 token from several others ERC1155 tokens. 
   This way X iron ingot becomes a sword
3. Crafting mechanic could be configured the other way around allowing user to dismantle items.
   This way a sword could become an Y iron ingots

To start crafting items you have to create [resources](/admin/hierarchy/ERC1155/template/) first

> **NOTE!** In standalone application merchant can configure craft to use 3rd party tokens and
> exchange say [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) for their own tokens
