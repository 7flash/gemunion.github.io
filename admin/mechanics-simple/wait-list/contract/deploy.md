# Deployment

WaitList contract is being deployed using [Contract Manager](/admin/miscellaneous/contract-manager/)

> **NOTE!** Users of Launchpad can deploy only one WaitList contract and this counts as a start of billing period
> While users of Standalone version can deploy as many WaitList contracts as they like however we see no use case for this

## Deployment options

There are no option for this contract
