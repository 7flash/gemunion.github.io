# Vesting

Vesting is usually used to lock investors funds and unlock them using time-base function. This means investors still can
use their bound to gain profit by selling it or by using it for governance but can't just sell tokens on the market.

## Actions

As one investor can have more than one vesting contract assigned to him with different schedule we display a filterable
list of available contracts with action buttons. These buttons allow to view contract details, transfer contract
ownership to another account and release vested funds.

NOTE: Vested funds can be used for [governance](/market/complex-mechanics/governance/)
