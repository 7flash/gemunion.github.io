# Cognito

Cognito login provider is a part of an integration with Amazon Cloud. The main goal of this provider is deep
integration with other AWS services that the company may already have.

The main advantages of Cognito are

- deep integration with other AWS services
- connection to social networks (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- a creation of users pools
- builtin 2FA (two-factor authorizations)
- builtin localization
- builtin password recovery flow

Unlike [Firebase](/api/authorization/firebase/), Cognito has no integrations with gaming platforms which makes it less
suitable for games.
